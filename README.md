Quick Snippits and Utils Designed For NGS

This is a work in progress. I will be adding as frequently as possible. There will be one "MAIN" pipeline
that will utilize all of the .sh scripts, however not necessary to use the tools.
I have tried to make them as portable as possible, and included adequate
comment sections. 

I intend on including some shortcut lists for the pre-reqs, including how to thread and maximize CPU usage. 

Enjoy! I hope they help anyone.

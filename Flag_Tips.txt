Tips For Various Flag Calls In Various Commonly Used Computational Software.

## Don't Need A SAM File?

Pipe Minimap2 into SORT--

Simple EX :
Minimap2 -ax map-ont -t 20 ./REFERENCE_GENOME.fa --junc-bed ./BED.bed ./SAMPLE.fastq.gz | samtools sort -o FILENAME.sorted.bam -@10
samtools index FILENAME.sorted.bam



                                                              ###BCFTOOLS###

## MAX MEMORY--

When calling "Sort" use the "-m" flag. This will set max memory to use. (Sort makes temp files,
by default in 128 MB blocks. This can be problematic with your systems "Upper Limit" as
only X amount of files may remain in temporary space at once. This flag should be followed by
an integer and datasize format. This will make fewer files of a larger size. 

To check your "Upper Limit" in Ubuntu type the command "ulimit -n"
Most likely this will return "1024"
I don't advise changing this, but you can. 

Simple EX : 
bamtools sort -m 10G -o FILENAME.BAM 


## THREADING--
Threading is useful for speeding up processing, Should you have capable hardware.
The command is used by calling "-@" at the end of your command. Follow this with the number of 
threads youd like to utilize. 

Something like -
# of cores in processor * 2 = X
X * # of processors = Max Thread
(Don't qoute me on that...)

Simple EX :
bamtools sort -m 10G -o FILENAME.BAM -@10
